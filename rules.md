# Liverpool Rummy: All Rounds and Their Requirements

Liverpool Rummy is played over seven rounds, each with a specific
combination of sets (books) and runs (sequences) that players must
lay down to go out. The requirements for each round become progressively
more challenging. Here are the round-by-round requirements:

		  |                                                             | Total Cards
Round | Requirement                                                 | Needed
------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------
  1   | Two books of three (2 sets of 3 cards)                      | 6
  2   | One book of three and one run of four                       | 7
  3   | Two runs of four                                            | 8
  4   | Three books of three                                        | 9
  5   | Two books of three and one run of four                      | 10
  6   | One book of three and two runs of four                      | 11
  7   | Three runs of four (no remaining cards, no discard allowed) | 12

## Explanation of Terms

* Book (Set/Group):
  Three or more cards of the same rank (e.g., 8♥ 8♣ 8♠).

* Run (Sequence):
  Four or more consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 3♥ 4♥ 5♥ 6♥).
  Aces can be high or low, but runs cannot "wrap around" from King to Ace to 2.

## Special Notes

* In the final round (Round 7), you must use all your cards in the required
  melds and cannot finish with a discard.

* The contract for each round must be met exactly as specified before you
  can lay down your cards.

These requirements are standard for Liverpool Rummy, though some house rules
may slightly vary the number of rounds or cards dealt. The above list reflects
the most widely accepted version.
