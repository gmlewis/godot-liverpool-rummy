### Key Components

- **animation_duration**: Default 3.0 seconds (configurable)
- **Parallel Tweens**: All cards animate simultaneously with staggered delays
- **Card Flipping**: Cards flip to show faces mid-animation, then flip back
- **Z-Index Management**: Cards stack properly at the end
- **Position/Rotation/Scale**: All animated smoothly using tweens

## Animation Selection

### Manual Selection
```gdscript
await card_shuffler.shuffle_deck(CardShuffler.ShuffleType.SPIRAL_SWIRL)
```

### Random Selection
```gdscript
await card_shuffler.random_shuffle()
```

The game uses `random_shuffle()` to automatically vary animations between rounds, keeping the experience fresh.

## Technical Implementation

### Tween System

All animations use Godot's `Tween` class with parallel execution:

```gdscript
var tween = create_tween()
tween.set_parallel(true)  # All cards animate simultaneously

for i in range(cards.size()):
    var card = cards[i]
    var delay = i * delay_factor  # Stagger for visual effect
    
    tween.tween_property(card, "position", target_pos, duration).set_delay(delay)
    tween.tween_property(card, "rotation", target_rot, duration).set_delay(delay)
    tween.tween_callback(card.flip_card).set_delay(delay + flip_offset)

await tween.finished
```

### Card Flipping

Cards flip using their built-in `flip_card()` method:
- Flip is a separate animation on the card itself
- Takes `flip_duration` seconds (default 0.5s)
- Must account for flip duration when calculating delays

### Helper Functions

**`_calc_delay_factor()`**
Calculates delay between cards to ensure last card completes before phase ends:
```gdscript
func _calc_delay_factor(offset: float, phase_duration: float, card_flip_duration: float) -> float:
    var last_card_flip_offset = phase_duration - offset - card_flip_duration
    return last_card_flip_offset / (cards.size() - 1)
```

**`_ease_in_out()`**
Custom easing function for smooth acceleration/deceleration:
```gdscript
func _ease_in_out(t: float) -> float:
    return t * t * (3.0 - 2.0 * t)  # Smoothstep
```

**`_collapse_to_stack()`**
Standard ending sequence used by most animations:
- Randomized delays for organic feel
- Back-easing for "settling" effect
- Z-index animation for proper stacking
- Small position/rotation randomization

**`_spiral_converge_to_stack()`**
Specialized ending with spiral effect:
- Used by ORBITAL_DANCE
- 3 rotations while converging
- Custom easing

## Adding New Animations

To create a new shuffle animation:

1. **Add to enum:**
```gdscript
enum ShuffleType {
    // ... existing types
    MY_NEW_SHUFFLE,
}
```

2. **Add to match statement:**
```gdscript
match shuffle_type:
    // ... existing cases
    ShuffleType.MY_NEW_SHUFFLE:
        Global.dbg('shuffling with MY_NEW_SHUFFLE')
        await _my_new_shuffle()
```

3. **Implement the animation function:**
```gdscript
func _my_new_shuffle():
    # Phase 1: Initial positioning
    for i in range(cards.size()):
        var card = cards[i]
        card.force_face_down()
        card.position = # ... starting position
        card.rotation = # ... starting rotation
        card.scale = # ... starting scale
        card.z_index = i
    
    # Phase 2: Main animation
    var tween = create_tween()
    tween.set_parallel(true)
    
    for i in range(cards.size()):
        var card = cards[i]
        card.flip_duration = DEFAULT_CARD_FLIP_DURATION
        var delay = i * some_delay_factor
        
        # Animate properties
        tween.tween_property(card, "position", target, duration).set_delay(delay)
        tween.tween_callback(card.flip_card).set_delay(delay + flip_time)
    
    await tween.finished
    
    # Phase 3: Collapse to stack
    await _collapse_to_stack(remaining_duration)
```

4. **Add to random_shuffle list:**
```gdscript
func random_shuffle():
    var shuffle_types = [
        // ... existing types
        ShuffleType.MY_NEW_SHUFFLE,
    ]
```

### Animation Design Tips

1. **Use 2-3 distinct phases** for visual interest
2. **Stagger card animations** with small delays for organic feel
3. **Include at least one flip** so players see card faces briefly
4. **End with collapse_to_stack()** for consistency
5. **Use easing** for professional polish
6. **Test at different screen sizes** - use Global.screen_size and Global.screen_center
7. **Keep duration around 3 seconds** - shorter feels rushed, longer gets boring
8. **Vary scale** during animation for depth perception

### Performance Considerations

- **Parallel tweens are efficient** - Godot handles them well
- **Avoid per-frame callbacks** - use tween_property instead of tween_method when possible
- **Z-index changes are cheap** - don't worry about animating them
- **108 cards animate smoothly** - the system handles full deck well

## Configuration

### Export Variables
```gdscript
@export var animation_duration: float = 3.0  # Total animation time
@export var final_ending_card_rotation_delta: float = 0.0  # Final stack rotation
```

### Constants
```gdscript
const DEFAULT_CARD_FLIP_DURATION = 0.5  # Time for card flip animation
```

## Debugging

Enable debug output to see shuffle selection:
```gdscript
Global.dbg('shuffling with SPIRAL_SWIRL')
```

To test a specific animation during development:
```gdscript
# In StartRoundShuffleState or wherever shuffle is called
await card_shuffler.shuffle_deck(CardShuffler.ShuffleType.EXPLOSION_GATHER)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- **Sound effects** for whooshes, flips, and card contact
- **Particle effects** for explosions and sparkles
- **Camera shake** for dramatic moments
- **Difficulty-based selection** - simpler animations early, complex later
- **Player preferences** - let players pick favorite or disable random
- **Combo animations** - chain multiple styles together
- **Theme variations** - holiday or special event shuffles
